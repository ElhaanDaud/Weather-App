This is a simple weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a specific city. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.

## Features

- The app displays the city name, temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, wind speed in kilometers per hour, and a corresponding weather icon.
